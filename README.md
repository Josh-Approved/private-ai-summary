# Private AI Summary

A Chrome extension that summarizes the page you're on — articles, YouTube videos, recipes — using the AI model built into your browser. Your data stays with you.

## What it does

- **Article summary.** Key points from any page, in seconds.
- **YouTube summary.** The gist of a video without watching it.
- **Recipe view.** Pulls the actual recipe out of the storytelling.
- **News critique.** A short read on tone, framing, and what the article leaves out.

All of it runs on Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano. No API keys, no server round-trips, no account.

## Who it's for

Anyone who reads a lot online and wants quick summaries without sending every page they visit to a third-party server. If you've tried summarization extensions and uninstalled them once you noticed the privacy policy, this is the same shape of tool with the privacy problem removed.

## How to get it

Install it via [Private AI Summary - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/private-ai-summary/jbfgdnfdmolgdpohlcclaolkcanddjnm)

Or load it as an unpacked extension — see below.

## Run it locally

You'll need Chrome 138 or newer with Gemini Nano enabled. One-time Chrome setup:

1. Visit `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model` and set it to **Enabled BypassPerfRequirement**.
2. Restart Chrome.
3. Visit `chrome://components` and find **Optimization Guide On Device Model**. Click **Check for update** and wait for it to download.

Then load the extension:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Josh-Approved/private-ai-summary.git`
2. Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `private-ai-summary` folder.
4. Pin the extension and click its icon on any page.

## Privacy

Your data stays with you. Page content is processed by the AI model built into Chrome — nothing is sent to a server, nothing is logged. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full posture.
